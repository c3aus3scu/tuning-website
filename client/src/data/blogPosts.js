        <h2>What is a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF)?</h2>
        <p>A DPF is a device fitted to modern diesel vehicles to reduce soot emissions. Over time, it can clog and cause power loss, increased fuel consumption, and warning lights.</p>

        <h2>Why Remove It?</h2>
        <p>Removing the DPF can restore performance, reduce fuel usage, and eliminate recurring faults. It's a common option for off-road vehicles or motorsport use.</p>

        <h2>Is It Legal in the UK?</h2>
        <p>No. DPF removal is illegal on vehicles used on public roads in the UK. MOT failures and legal penalties may apply. It is only recommended for track or off-road vehicles.</p>

        <h2>What is Stage 1 Remapping?</h2>
        <p>Stage 1 is a software-only remap of the ECU (Engine Control Unit) that optimizes parameters like boost, fuel and ignition for more performance – without needing any physical upgrades.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Stage 1</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Up to 35% more power and torque</li>
          <li>Improved throttle response</li>
          <li>Better fuel economy under normal driving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Is it Safe?</h2>
        <p>Yes. Stage 1 maps stay within the safe operating limits of your engine. It’s a reliable way to get more out of your car without compromising durability.</p>

        <h2>What is AdBlue?</h2>
        <p>AdBlue is a urea-based solution used in SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) systems to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions in diesel engines.</p>

        <h2>Why Delete It?</h2>
        <p>When the AdBlue system fails, repairs can be expensive. Deleting it removes errors, disables dosing, and prevents vehicle shutdown. Common in off-road/fleet applications.</p>

        <h2>Is AdBlue Delete Legal?</h2>
        <p>Only for off-road or motorsport vehicles. Driving on public roads with a disabled SCR system is illegal in the UK.</p>

        <h2>What is a Dyno Test?</h2>
        <p>A dyno (dynamometer) measures your car’s power at the wheels (WHP) and torque output. It's used for diagnostics and performance verification.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Dyno Testing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Check actual power and torque</li>
          <li>Compare before/after tuning results</li>
          <li>Fine-tune ECU maps for maximum safety</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Is It Safe?</h2>
        <p>Yes, when performed by professionals. Dyno testing is standard in performance garages and has no risk to your engine.</p>
